# Network-Scanning

Hands-on experience in network security assessment and vulnerability analysis.
Project Focus:
- Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to detect anomalies and inspect communication patterns.
- Leveraged Nmap NSE scripts (msrpc-enum, http-title, nbstat) to enumerate services, extract web information, and assess security risks.
- Evaluated firewall/IDS evasion techniques to understand network defense mechanisms.
